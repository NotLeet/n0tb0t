'''
before I write code let's think...
a serviceconfig is going to be a dict that then gets used to construct a service object
different service types can have more keys in the dict, the templates here hhave the bare minimum
potentially move the service config default to service class inside of a getter and then make others call super() on it
use the @attribute things
